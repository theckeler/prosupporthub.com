  <p>
    By opting in to or using the DeWalt Pro Support Hub text message service

    any right to participate in class actions, all as detailed in the “Disputes”
    section below.
  </p>

      in which MTD sends (or indicates that it may send or receives a request
      that it send) one or more text messages.<br />
        b. <strong>"Opting In," "Opt In"</strong> and
      <strong>"Opt-In"</strong> to refer to requesting, joining, agreeing to,

  </div>

  <p>
     2. <span class="underlined">Opting In.</span>
    From time to time, MTD may advertise the opportunity to participate in the
    Text Service and receive alerts and information via text message from
    MTDLLC, including each of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates. You
    acknowledge and agree that you are opting into the Text Service by texting a
    specific keyword to a specific short code as specified in the applicable MTD
    message. After Opting In, in addition to the main messages the service
    offers, you may receive one or more welcome messages or administrative
    messages, such as (in some cases) a request to confirm your Opt-In. By
    opting in:
  </p>

  <p>
      a. You authorize MTD to use autodialer or non-autodialer technology to
    send text messages to the cell phone number associated with your opt in
    (i.e., the number listed on the Opt-In form or instructions, or, if none,
    the number from which you send the Opt-In, or, if none, the number on file
    for the account associated with your Opt-In). You also authorize MTD to
    include marketing content in any such messages. You do not have to Opt-In or
    agree to Opt-In as a condition of purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
      b. You confirm that you are the subscriber to the relevant phone number or
    that you are the customary user of that number on a family or business plan
    and that you are authorized to opt-in.
  </p>
  <p>
      c. You are signing your Opt-In to the Text Service. You consent to the use
    of an electronic record to document your opt-in.
  </p>

  <p>
     3. <span class="underlined">More information and Opting Out.</span>
    Message and data rates may apply. Unless otherwise noted, MTD may send
    multiple, recurring messages and/or terminate the Text Service or your
    participation in it at any time with or without notice, including, for
    example, before you have received any or all messages that you otherwise
    would have received. For Text Services, text HELP for help and STOP to opt
    out. Your opt-out request may generate either a confirmation text or a
    texted request to clarify the Text Service to which it applies (if you have
    more than one). To complete your opt-out, please provide the requested
    clarification.
  </p>

  <p>
     6. <span class="underlined">Termination.</span>

  </p>

  <p>
     7. <span class="underlined">Changes.</span>
    MTD may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting. If you are
    enrolled in Text Services, MTD will send a text message to note that the
    Terms have been amended. If you continue to use the Text Services following

    to change and consolidate associated short codes. Your sole remedy if you do
    not agree with a revised Terms, or if you do not agree to receive text
    messages from new short codes is to opt out.
  </p>

  <p>
     8. <span class="underlined">Disputes.</span>
    <strong>
      Please read this “Disputes” section carefully. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION,
      YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER
      AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE
      PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE
      DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY. ALTHOUGH REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN
      ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS
      WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT AND MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED
      IN THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD. This arbitration clause shall
      survive termination of these Terms and Conditions.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
     a. <i>Binding Arbitration.</i>
    This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all
    disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, your
    participation in the Text Service, or your relationship with MTD. Any
    dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, your access to
    or participation in the Text Service, or your relationship with MTDor any
    subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in
    contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory)
    will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either party may take
    claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.
  </p>

  <p>
     b. <i>Arbitration Procedures.</i> For all disputes, whether pursued in
    court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your
    claim to MTD’s Customer Service department to allow us an opportunity to
    resolve the dispute. You and MTD each agree to negotiate your claim in good
    faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be
    resolved within 60 days. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be
    conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
    Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as
    applicable), as modified by these Term. The AAA Rules and information about
    arbitration and fees are available online at
    <span class="green-text">www.adr.org</span>. An arbitrator may award on an
    individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including
    injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your
    individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would.
    Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor MTD may disclose
    the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be
    required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.
    Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper
    jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
     c. <i>Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver.</i>
    You and MTD each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in
    court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
    consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines
    in an action between you and MTD that this class action waiver is
    unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If for any
    reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we
    each waive any right to a jury trial.
  </p>
  <p>
     d. <i>Governing Law.</i>
    Any dispute arising from these Terms or your access to or participation in
    the Text Service will be governed by and construed and enforced in
    accordance with the laws of Ohio, without regard to conflict of law rules or
    principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
    Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. Any dispute between the parties
    that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court
    will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Medina County,
    Ohio.
